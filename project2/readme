Known Bugs: -the commands from test.dat must be typed exactly as shown:
                         -> to add, type "add #" where # is the desired value.
                         -> to delete, type "delete"
                         -> any misspelling will result in an error
            -the commands from test.dat are case sensitive, only lowercase commands will work
            -if no number is included after the add command, the previous number will be added again
                         -> add 5
                            add
                            results in the number 5 being added twice
